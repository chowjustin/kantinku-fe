This is the frontend repository for **KantinKu ITS**, a web application designed to streamline the food ordering process within the ITS campus environment. It provides a modern, user-friendly interface for both students and canteen tenants.

## ‚ú® Features

The application is split into two main user experiences for Students and Tenants, with a rich set of features for each.

### üë®‚Äçüéì For Students

* **Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for students.
* **Tenant Discovery**: Browse a list of all available food tenants on campus from the homepage.
* **Menu Viewing**: View detailed tenant pages with their complete menu, including descriptions, prices, and stock availability.
* **Interactive Cart**:
    * Add items to a shopping cart directly from a tenant's menu.
    * The cart intelligently handles orders, prompting the user for confirmation if they try to order from a new tenant while having items from another in their cart.
    * A persistent cart footer provides a summary and quick access to the checkout page.
* **Seamless Checkout**: A simple, multi-step checkout process with payment gateway integration.
* **Order Tracking**:
    * View a complete history of past and current orders.
    * Track the real-time status of payments and order preparation (e.g., Pending, Processing, Ready for Pickup).
* **Profile Management**: Students can view and edit their personal information and change their password.
* **Map Integration**: View the exact location of a tenant's canteen on an interactive map.

### üè™ For Tenants

* **Tenant Dashboard**: A dedicated dashboard for tenants to manage their operations.
* **Order Queue Management**: View incoming orders in a real-time queue. Tenants can update the status of each order (Pending, Processing, Ready, Completed) to keep students informed.
* **Menu Management (CRUD)**:
    * Full control over their menu listings.
    * Add new menu items with details like name, description, price, and stock.
    * Edit existing items, including uploading new images for menu items.
    * Delete menu items that are no longer available.
* **Profile Management**: Tenants can update their profile, including their tenant name, contact information, and profile/store image.
* **Canteen Registration with Map**: A special registration form for new tenants, featuring a coordinate selector to pinpoint their canteen's location on a map.
